There are two STLs that can be printed without supports at a 0.2mm layer height with PLA. 
The Arduino is wired and inserted into the case and a zip tie is added to the wire to provide strain relief. There is a slot to tuck the zip tie into once affixed to the RJ-11 wire.
The two halves of the case snap together with tabs once the board is in place. Make sure that the zip tie is fully tucked into the slot before closing the two halves.
