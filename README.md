# WiiHero
WiiHero is a utility program that allows you to use your **Nintendo Wii guitar** on your PC. By using an **Arduino** as a proxy, we emulate a **XBOX 360 controller** to Windows and use that to play all games we want.

### How to play

To use WiiHero, you have to follow these steps:

1. Connect to your Arduino over serial.
2. Select which controller you want to play on (For multiple players)
3. Install the driver **ScpDriverInstaller.exe** (Do this only one)
4. Press plug to plug in the virtual controller.

Pressing the background will show a colorpicker which allows you to change the background color if you prefer so.
